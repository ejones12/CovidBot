## Description:

Our CS5704 Project is to make a Discord Bot to communicate information about the Covid-19 pandemic in a uniform manner to SE teams. We are using this to "Troubleshoot" communication problems that occur during the pandemic and affect software engineers. The bot can be added to a Discord server. When the bot is on a server, users can send commands to the bot that will allow them to request immediate updates about the pandemic, request daily scheduled alerts about the pandemic relating to masks, travel, and/or vaccines, and unsubscribe from receiving alerts. The back end functionality scrapes the CDC's Twitter for the relevant information at the correct times. This allows software engineering teams to receive unified updates about the pandemic.

## Commands: 

All commands to the bot begin with an '!'. The following are the commands that the bot understands.

!help: gives a list of commands the bot understands  
!alerts: subscribe to Covid-19 alerts  
--all: subscribe to all categories  
--categories: get list of categories  
!unsubscribe: unsubscribe from Covid-19 alerts  
--all: unsubscribe from all categories  
--categories: get list of categories  
!information: request immediate information
